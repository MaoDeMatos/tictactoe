# TS Tic Tac Toe

## Functionnalities

This app lets you play tictactoe with an "AI" (an algorithm) that plays the role of the 2nd player.

It records the history of game results in your browser's local storage.

Players can :

- Choose is they want to play the "X" or "O" symbol
- Choose their usename

## Future upgrades (?)

- [ ] Change who plays first depending on the symbol the player chose
- [ ] Add a proper router for page management

## Caveats

Some animations/styles don't work/are janky on Firefox.

To ensure all functionalities work as expected, you should use a Chromium-based browser like Google Chrome, latest versions of Edge, Opera, etc.
